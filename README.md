This is the "Status?" originally should be shown in JA HK competetion in 2022, but don’t know why the organizer didn’t add our names on it and can’t be presented.
I put it here for memorizing and mark the coding skills in 2022 just in case I come back later to see.

This is a prototype and not connected to any server, modifying some variables will make it work.
